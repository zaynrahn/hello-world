# hello-world
First time on GitHub >=)
I started learning programming with Python and built a few small programs here and there. I am self-taught and have used resources such as Learn Python The Hard Way and Coursera to increase my knowledge of programming in Python. I am looking forward to learning more since I hope to switch careers to being a Developer where I can be creative and possess magical abilities to create things out of nothing to positive impact society! 

Personal Story: I have lived in 6 countries, two of which are considered third-world countries where I saw levels of poverty, corruption, and ineqaulity unimaginable to the average Western citizen. My experiences in these countries gave me a perspective which I am grateful for to this today. My goal is to use my career and to channel my inner desire to help others whether in third-world microfinancing, sports recruitment, educating disabled students, providing cheap education to students in developing countries, and whatever else may help to create a better future for humanity. I have a lot of ideas and a great desire to help others so I am positive my journey to be developer will provide the perfect outlet!

Thank you for taking the time to read this and please check out some of my code. Since I am always trying to get better, feel free to refer me to resources, tools, or even comment on best practices which can help me learn more.
